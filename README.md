# Chicago Bears Api
An API showing some of the members of the Chicago Bears

**Link to project:** https://bears-roster-api.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, hosted on Heroku

The server was created using node and express. The HTML is a simple index.html file.

## Lessons Learned:

First project uploaded to a cloud platform with a server that I coded. Need more comfort level with setting up node/express and getting used to the syntax.
